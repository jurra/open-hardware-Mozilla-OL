# open-hardware-Mozilla-OL-track
Documentation of learning program for open hardware including education materials, best practices, licenses, project sustainability and more. The idea here is to work on a specialized track that is similar to Mozilla Open Leaders program, but with a focus on open hardware development projects.

## Why
Open hardware its a domain with its own specificities, core competences, culture and also challenges. Open hardware combines the production of intangible and tangible outcomes, which implies the aquisition of material resources and fabrication activities. This aspect makes the adoption and scalability of open hardware a bit more complex. Furthermore there are tools, resources and practices from software that can be also transfered to hardware developers like git, github, gitlab and more.

### For these reasons we think it is relevant to have a dedicated track open hardware track where people acquire complementary hardware and fabrication skills as open leaders

## Goals 
- Introduce best practices and tools in open hardware
- Share examples of open hardware projects
- Share examples of tools, processes
- Expose the community also to the contradictions and challenges of developing open hardware
- Develop community centered skills to scale up open hardware projects

## Ideas for the Roadmap
- Hackathon to develop content for the track
- Launch first course
- ..... other ideas??
